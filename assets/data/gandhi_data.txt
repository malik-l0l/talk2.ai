Mahatma Gandhi (1869-1948) - The Father of Indian Independence

Early Life and Education:
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, a coastal town in present-day Gujarat, India. He came from a family of merchants and government officials. Gandhi studied law in London and was admitted to the bar in 1891.

Satyagraha - The Philosophy of Non-violent Resistance:
Gandhi developed the concept of Satyagraha, meaning "holding onto truth" or "truth-force." This philosophy emphasized non-violent resistance to injustice through civil disobedience, non-cooperation, and moral persuasion. Gandhi believed that means are as important as ends, and that violence corrupts both the user and the cause.

Key Principles and Teachings:

Truth (Satya): 
Gandhi considered truth as the most important virtue. He said, "Truth is God and God is Truth." He believed that one should never compromise on truth, even if it leads to difficulties.

Non-violence (Ahimsa):
Ahimsa was central to Gandhi's philosophy. He extended non-violence beyond physical harm to include thoughts, words, and actions. Gandhi said, "Non-violence is the greatest force at the disposal of mankind. It is mightier than the mightiest weapon of destruction."

Self-rule (Swaraj):
Gandhi advocated for Swaraj, which meant self-rule both at individual and national levels. He believed that true independence comes from self-discipline and moral development.

Simple Living:
Gandhi practiced and preached simple living. He wore simple clothes, ate simple food, and lived in modest accommodations. He said, "Live simply so that others may simply live."

Unity of Religions:
Gandhi respected all religions and believed they all led to the same truth. He said, "I regard Jesus Christ as the greatest teacher of ahimsa that the world has ever had."

Economic Philosophy:
Gandhi opposed industrialization and favored village-based economy. He promoted cottage industries and self-sufficiency. The spinning wheel (charkha) became a symbol of Indian independence and economic self-reliance.

Major Movements and Campaigns:

South Africa (1893-1915):
Gandhi first employed Satyagraha in South Africa to fight racial discrimination. He organized the Indian community to resist discriminatory laws and taxes.

Champaran Satyagraha (1917):
Gandhi's first major campaign in India was in Champaran, Bihar, where he fought for the rights of indigo farmers against British landlords.

Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922):
Gandhi launched this movement to resist British rule through non-violent non-cooperation. Indians were asked to boycott British goods, institutions, and honors.

Salt March (1930):
The famous Dandi March was a 240-mile walk to the sea to make salt, breaking the British monopoly on salt production. This became a symbol of Indian resistance.

Quit India Movement (1942):
Gandhi's final major campaign demanded an end to British rule in India. His slogan was "Do or Die."

On Anger and Conflict:
Gandhi said, "Anger is the enemy of non-violence and pride is a monster that swallows it up." He believed that one should never act in anger and that true strength comes from controlling one's emotions.

On Leadership:
"Be the change you wish to see in the world." Gandhi emphasized leading by example and personal transformation as the basis for social change.

On Education:
Gandhi believed in holistic education that develops the body, mind, and spirit. He emphasized practical learning and moral development alongside academic knowledge.

On Women:
Gandhi was a strong advocate for women's rights and empowerment. He said, "Woman is the companion of man, gifted with equal mental capacity."

Final Years and Death:
Gandhi was assassinated on January 30, 1948, by Nathuram Godse while on his way to a prayer meeting. His last words were "Hey Ram" (Oh God).

Legacy:
Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence influenced civil rights leaders worldwide, including Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela. His birthday, October 2, is celebrated as the International Day of Non-Violence.
